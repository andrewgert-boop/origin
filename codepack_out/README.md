# CodePack Output

This folder was generated by `codepack.py` on 2025-09-02T07:57:05.200903Z.

## Files
- `code.jsonl` — the source code, chunked for LLM ingestion (one JSON per line).
- `manifest.json` — summary stats and file/chunk mapping.
- `file_list.csv` — list of included files with sizes and chunk counts.
- `prompt_user_ru.md`, `prompt_user_en.md` — ready prompts for analysis.

## Tips
- Upload `arch.md` and `summary.yaml` next to `code.jsonl` if available (e.g., produced by archsnap.py).
- If your LLM tool supports multiple files, include all of the above.
- If there's an upload size limit, split `code.jsonl` into multiple parts (by lines).
- Secrets: `.env*` is excluded, and common secrets are masked. Still review before sharing externally.
